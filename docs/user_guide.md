## Overview

This Databricks project provides an end-to-end data processing and machine learning pipeline that handles:

1. Data ingestion from various sources
2. Data transformation and feature engineering
3. Machine learning model training and evaluation
4. Batch scoring using trained models
5. Reporting and visualization of results

Each stage is implemented as a separate notebook in the `notebooks/` directory, allowing for modular execution and development.

## Data Ingestion

### Running the Data Ingestion Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/data_ingestion.py`
2. Set the following parameters:
   - `data_source`: Path to your data source (e.g., S3 bucket, JDBC connection)
   - `target_table`: Name of the target Delta table
   - `ingest_mode`: "full" for complete reload, "incremental" for CDC-based updates
   - `checkpoint_path`: Location to store checkpoint information for streaming

3. Run the notebook

### Supported Data Sources

The ingestion notebook supports the following data sources:
- CSV files in cloud storage
- JSON files
- JDBC databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- Streaming sources

### Customizing Ingestion

To customize data ingestion:
1. Modify the schema definitions in the notebook to match your data structure
2. Adjust the data quality checks to fit your requirements
3. For new data sources, add a new ingestion function following the existing patterns

## Data Processing

### Running the Data Processing Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/data_processing.py`
2. Ensure the source tables from data ingestion exist
3. Run the notebook

### Processing Operations

The processing notebook performs the following operations:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Data normalization and scaling
- Categorical encoding
- Time-based feature creation

### Customizing Processing

To customize data processing:
1. Modify the transformation logic to fit your specific use case
2. Add new feature engineering steps as needed
3. Adjust the quality checks to match your requirements

## Machine Learning

### Running the Machine Learning Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/machine_learning.py`
2. Ensure the processed data tables exist
3. Run the notebook

### ML Capabilities

The machine learning notebook includes:
- Feature selection
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GBT)
- Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Model registration to MLflow Registry

### Customizing Machine Learning

To customize the machine learning process:
1. Add or remove models from the training pipeline
2. Modify the hyperparameter grids for tuning
3. Add custom evaluation metrics
4. Change the feature selection approach

## Batch Scoring

### Running the Batch Scoring Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/batch_scoring.py`
2. Set the following parameters:
   - `model_name`: Name of the registered model to use
   - `model_version`: Version of the model ("latest", "production", or a specific version number)
   - `input_table`: Table containing data to score
   - `output_table`: Table to store predictions
   - `output_mode`: "overwrite", "append", or "merge"

3. Run the notebook

### Scoring Features

The batch scoring notebook provides:
- Model loading from MLflow Registry
- Data preprocessing for model input
- Batch prediction generation
- Prediction explanation (if model supports it)
- Result storage in Delta tables

### Customizing Scoring

To customize the scoring process:
1. Modify the preprocessing logic to match your model's requirements
2. Add post-processing steps for predictions
3. Implement custom output formats

## Reporting

### Running the Reporting Notebook

1. Navigate to `notebooks/reporting.py`
2. Set the following parameters:
   - `data_table`: Table containing predictions
   - `report_path`: Path to save reports
   - `time_period`: "day", "week", or "month"

3. Run the notebook

### Report Types

The reporting notebook generates:
- Summary statistics of predictions
- Time series analysis of prediction patterns
- Distribution analysis by category
- Value distribution analysis
- Probability distribution charts

### Customizing Reports

To customize the reporting:
1. Add new visualizations to highlight specific insights
2. Modify existing charts to match your branding or preferences
3. Add export options for different formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)

## Modifying the Pipeline

### Adding a New Step

To add a new step to the pipeline:

1. Create a new notebook in the `notebooks/` directory
2. Follow the pattern of existing notebooks (parameters, documentation, etc.)
3. Update the job configuration in `config/job_config.json` to include the new step
4. Add appropriate dependencies between steps

### Changing the Data Model

To change the data model:

1. Update schema definitions in the data ingestion notebook
2. Modify transformation logic in the data processing notebook
3. Update feature engineering in the machine learning notebook
4. Test the changes through the entire pipeline

### Adding New Models

To add a new machine learning model:

1. Add the model implementation in the machine learning notebook
2. Include it in the hyperparameter tuning and evaluation sections
3. Update the model comparison logic
4. Test the model performance

## Working with Results

### Accessing Delta Tables

To query the Delta tables:

```python
# In a Databricks notebook
predictions = spark.table("predictions")
display(predictions.limit(10))

# Run SQL queries
spark.sql("SELECT category, prediction, COUNT(*) FROM predictions GROUP BY category, prediction").show()
```

### Accessing MLflow Experiments

To view model experiments in MLflow:

1. Go to the "Experiments" section in the Databricks workspace
2. Find the experiment by name
3. Compare runs and view metrics
4. See model artifacts and parameters

### Exporting Results

To export results:

```python
# Export as CSV
predictions.write.format("csv").option("header", "true").save("/mnt/exports/predictions.csv")

# Export as Parquet
predictions.write.format("parquet").save("/mnt/exports/predictions.parquet")
```

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

- Use Delta Lake for all table storage
- Partition large tables appropriately
- Use Z-ordering for frequently filtered columns
- Cache intermediate tables when necessary
- Use appropriate cluster sizes for your data volume

### Development Workflow

1. Develop and test in notebook-based iterations
2. Refactor common code to modules in `src/`
3. Use version control for code changes
4. Test changes on a development cluster before production
5. Document changes thoroughly

### Monitoring and Maintenance

- Set up alerts for job failures
- Monitor cluster performance
- Check prediction quality regularly
- Retrain models when performance degrades
- Clean up old data and models to save storage

## Advanced Topics

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

For CI/CD integration:

1. Use a build tool like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
2. Implement automated testing
3. Set up automated deployment to development/staging/production
4. Implement approval workflows for production changes

### Multi-environment Setup

For different environments:

1. Create separate job configurations for dev/test/prod
2. Use environment-specific parameter files
3. Implement access controls for different environments

### Auto ML and Feature Store

For advanced ML capabilities:

1. Integrate Databricks AutoML for model selection
2. Use Databricks Feature Store for feature management
3. Implement a feature registry for reusable features
