## Key Components

### Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Databricks notebooks that serve as the primary interface for data processing and analytics:

- **data_ingestion.py**: Handles importing data from external sources (S3, databases, APIs, etc.) into Delta tables
- **data_processing.py**: Transforms raw data into processed datasets ready for analysis
- **machine_learning.py**: Contains ML model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation
- **batch_scoring.py**: Implements batch inference using trained models
- **reporting.py**: Generates visualizations and reports based on model predictions

### Source Code

The `src/` directory contains Python modules that can be imported by notebooks:

- **utils/**: Helper functions for common tasks
- **features/**: Feature engineering code
- **models/**: Custom model implementations
- **pipelines/**: Data pipeline components

### Configuration

The `config/` directory stores configuration files:

- **job_config.json**: Defines Databricks job configurations for orchestration
- **cluster_config.json**: Specifies compute cluster configurations
- **env/**: Environment-specific settings (dev, test, prod)

### Data and Models

- **data/**: Contains schema definitions and sample datasets
- **models/**: Stores trained models and registry information

### Tests and Documentation

- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for code validation
- **docs/**: Project documentation, setup guides, and user instructions

## Deployment Process

The typical development and deployment flow is:

1. Develop and test code in the notebooks
2. Refactor reusable components into the src/ modules
3. Configure jobs using the job configuration files
4. Deploy jobs to run on a schedule through the Databricks Jobs service

## Best Practices

When working with this project structure:

1. Keep notebooks focused on orchestration, visualization, and high-level logic
2. Move reusable code to Python modules in the src/ directory
3. Use Delta tables for all data storage to leverage transaction support and time travel
4. Track ML experiments with MLflow
5. Use the Databricks job scheduler for production workflows
6. Document configurations and requirements thoroughly
7. Maintain test coverage for critical components

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment
2. Set up a Databricks workspace
3. Upload the notebooks to your workspace
4. Configure authentication for data sources
5. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - data_ingestion.py
   - data_processing.py
   - machine_learning.py
   - batch_scoring.py
   - reporting.py
